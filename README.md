The goal is to save the eggs and larva from monsters. 
You can hold the left mouse and move the player. Push eggs into the forest and try to save as many as 30 and lose less than 5 to win the game.
D - for debugging mode. 
Soon, the trainer will be added to be able to change all possible parameters like (speed, time, number of eggs, monsters, condition, etc) from the menu.
